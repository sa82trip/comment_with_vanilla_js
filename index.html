<h1>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</h1>
	<p>
	With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.

	We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them.

	Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. Apple’s refurbished store provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are Amazon and Best Buy.

	MACBOOK AIR DEALS
	The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.
